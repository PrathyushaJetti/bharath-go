                    Bharathgo endeavors to provide a safe and efficient platform for customers to book and travel using two-wheeler services; however, please be aware that all information, services, and other resources provided on the Bharathgo platform, including the app and website, are offered on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Bharathgo makes no representations or warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied, regarding the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or suitability of the services provided. Use of this platform and the services provided therein is entirely at your own risk.
                </p>
                <h3>Ride Availability and Service Limitations</h3>
                <p>While Bharathgo makes every effort to provide consistent service across all locations where it operates, we do not guarantee the availability of rides in every area or at every time. Due to factors like weather conditions, technical issues, legal restrictions, and other unforeseeable events, service may be limited, delayed, or even unavailable in certain regions or at specific times. Bharathgo is not responsible for any inconvenience or loss that may arise from such limitations.


                    </p>
                <h3> Liability and Limitations:

                </h3>
                <p>Bharathgo disclaims liability for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential, that may arise from the use of its services, including but not limited to personal injury, loss of data, loss of revenue, or other damages. In no event shall Bharathgo be held liable for the actions or omissions of its independent driver-partners, including but not limited to any harm, injury, or damage resulting from negligence or misconduct. Users should exercise caution, and it is recommended to confirm identity and credentials through the app’s verification features before commencing any ride.


                </p>
                <h3> Driver-Partner Responsibilities </h3>
                <p>All driver-partners registered on the Bharathgo platform operate as independent contractors and not as employees, agents, or representatives of Bharathgo. They are responsible for complying with all applicable traffic and safety laws, ensuring their vehicles meet local safety standards, and maintaining all required documentation. Bharathgo does not assume responsibility for any failure by driver-partners to meet these obligations, nor does it bear any liability for damages arising from driver actions, including negligence or failure to meet legal requirements.

                </p>
                <h3>Insurance and Risk Acknowledgment </h3>
                <p>While driver-partners are required to have appropriate insurance coverage, passengers should be aware that Bharathgo itself does not offer insurance coverage for rides. By using the Bharathgo platform, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily engaging in an activity with inherent risks, including the potential for accidents or injuries. Bharathgo strongly recommends that passengers ensure their personal insurance covers potential incidents while using two-wheeler transport services. </p>
                <h3>Fare and Payment Disclaimer</h3>
                <p> 
                    Bharathgo strives to ensure that all fare calculations and payment processes are accurate and transparent. However, fares may vary based on time, distance, demand, and other factors, and are subject to change without prior notice. Bharathgo does not guarantee that fare estimations provided in the app are final or absolute. Users are responsible for verifying and accepting the fare before commencing a ride. Bharathgo is not liable for any additional charges or fees resulting from the ride.
                    </p>
                <h3>Data and Privacy Disclaimer </h3>
                <p>
