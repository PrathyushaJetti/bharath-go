                    Bharathgo offers a convenient way to book rides using two-wheelers, autos, and cabs through its app
                    and website. By using Bharathgo, you agree to follow these terms and conditions. Here’s a simple
                    summary of how Bharathgo works and what you need to know as a user.
                </p>
                <h3> General Use </h3>
                <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use Bharathgo. When you register, you’ll need to provide
                    accurate information and keep your account details safe. Sharing, duplicating, or creating multiple
                    accounts is not allowed, and any misuse could lead to account termination.

                    . </p>
                <h3> Services and Payment </h3>
                <p>Bharathgo connects you with drivers but does not directly provide transportation services. Your
                    contract for the ride or delivery is with the driver. Prices for rides are shown on the app, and you
                    can pay either through the app or in cash. Bharathgo does not handle cash disputes, so it’s
                    important to confirm the amount with the driver directly. </p>

                <p>Bharathgo expects users to respect its platform and drivers. Actions like tampering with the app,
                    uploading illegal content, or harming drivers are strictly prohibited. Misuse of Bharathgo’s
                    emergency feature could also lead to penalties. </p>
                <h3>Privacy and Safety </h3>
                <p>Bharathgo has an emergency alert feature in the app for your safety, but it should only be used in
                    real emergencies. The app collects personal information to improve its services, in line with its
                    Privacy Policy. Users must also keep their accounts and data secure.</p>
                <h3> Liability and Disputes </h3>
